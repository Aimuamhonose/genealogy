Here's a detailed roadmap for building a family tree website with an editable admin panel using the MERN stack:

---

### **Phase 1: Planning and Requirement Gathering**
1. **Understand the Requirements**
   - Define the family tree structure (e.g., hierarchical with parent-child relationships).
   - Determine the level of granularity (photos, dates, relationships, notes, etc.).
   - Discuss admin features (e.g., adding/editing/deleting members, creating branches, uploading photos).

2. **Sketch UI/UX**
   - Design wireframes for the family tree display and admin panel.
   - Plan mobile and desktop views for responsiveness.

3. **Define the Data Model**
   - Family Member Schema: `{ id, name, photo, birthDate, deathDate, parentIds, childrenIds, bio }`.
   - Admin User Schema: `{ username, passwordHash, email }`.

4. **Technology Stack**
   - MongoDB: Database for storing family member data.
   - Express.js: Backend API framework.
   - React.js: Frontend framework for dynamic UI.
   - Node.js: Backend runtime.
   - Other Tools: JWT for authentication, Multer for file uploads (photos), and CSS libraries like Tailwind or Material-UI for styling.

---

### **Phase 2: Setting Up the Environment**
1. **Initialize the Project**
   - Create a Git repository.
   - Set up the MERN environment:
     - Initialize Node.js (`npm init -y`).
     - Set up MongoDB (local or cloud).
     - Install required dependencies: `express`, `mongoose`, `jsonwebtoken`, `multer`, etc.

2. **Set Up Folder Structure**
   - `/backend`: API and server logic.
   - `/frontend`: React application.
   - `/config`: Config files for MongoDB, environment variables.

3. **Milestone**: Basic project structure with backend and frontend folders initialized.














---

### **Phase 3: Backend Development**
1. **Build APIs**
   - **Authentication**:
     - Admin login/logout endpoints (`POST /api/auth/login`).
     - Use JWT for session management.
   - **Family Tree Management**:
     - CRUD APIs for family members (`GET /api/members`, `POST /api/members`, `PUT /api/members/:id`, `DELETE /api/members/:id`).
     - Upload endpoint for photos (`POST /api/members/:id/photo` using `multer`).
   - **Family Tree Fetching**:
     - Recursive fetching endpoint for the hierarchical tree (`GET /api/tree`).

2. **Database Setup**
   - Define and test Mongoose schemas.
   - Seed initial data for testing.

3. **Milestone**: Backend API with complete CRUD and authentication functionality.

---

### **Phase 4: Frontend Development**
1. **Build the Admin Panel**
   - Create forms for:
     - Adding new members.
     - Editing member details.
     - Uploading photos.
   - Integrate with backend APIs.

2. **Build the Family Tree UI**
   - Use libraries like `react-d3-tree` or `react-family-tree` for visualization.
   - Handle responsiveness and dynamic updates when the tree changes.

3. **Authentication**
   - Implement login/logout functionality using JWT.
   - Protect admin routes with a private route component.

4. **File Upload Integration**
   - Allow photo uploads via the admin panel.

5. **Milestone**: Functional admin panel and family tree display.

---

### **Phase 5: Finalization**
1. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for backend endpoints.
   - Integration tests for frontend-backend interactions.
   - UI testing for edge cases (e.g., large family trees).

2. **Deployment**
   - Host the backend on services like Heroku or AWS.
   - Host the frontend on platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
   - Set up a MongoDB cluster on Atlas for production.

3. **Documentation**
   - Write admin instructions for using the panel.
   - Include API documentation for future maintenance.

4. **Milestone**: Deployed and documented family tree website.

---

### **Phase 6: Maintenance and Future Features**
1. **User Roles**
   - Add more user roles (e.g., viewer, contributor).
2. **Advanced Features**
   - Export/Import family tree data (e.g., JSON, PDF).
   - Search and filter functionality.
   - Timeline view of family events.

This roadmap ensures structured progress with clear milestones, making the project manageable and scalable.
